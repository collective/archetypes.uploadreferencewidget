Changelog for UploadReferenceWidget
===================================

1.1 (26-11-2007)
----------------

- Fixed a persistence bug in the TestCase who was causing tests to behave in
  different ways depending on how they were run or on the Plone version. [deo]

- Fixed the usage of 'startup_directory' in the demo.py code. [deo]

- Made sure the widget honors the "use the current object" as the 'startup_directory'
  when its value is "". [deo]

- Fixed the "can't save the object" problem when the widget's field is marked as
  required. [deo]


1.0.1 (16-11-2007)
------------------

- Reformulated the MonkeyPatch code to make it more robust and also to patch the
  right *class*. [deo]

- Amended a test to work on all Plone versions. [deo]


1.0 (14-112007)
---------------
- Fixed the text formatting of README.txt to use the StructuredText markup. [deo]

- Fixed to not upload files when the form validation fails. [deo]

- Added a MonkeyPatch for Archetypes BaseObject._processForm method, so we don't
  require the entire world to upgrade Archetypes to unreleased versions. [deo]



0.5 (30-10 2007)
----------------

- Fixed to use the reference_edit macro from ATReferenceBrowserWidget
  (present in 1.7.2 and 2.0.1 versions), when available. This removes the double
  title/description field text. [deo]

- Added a multi-upload feature. You can now upload more than one file at a time
  when the widget support multiple values. [deo]

- Fixed a bug where the directory path wasn't being removed from the filename,
  when uploading from Internet Explorer to a Zope server running in OS different
  from Windows. [deo]

- Improved the 'startup_directory' handling: if the path doesn't exists, the files
  are uploaded inside the instance itself (in case of a folderish object), or
  its parent. [deo]


0.2 (10-09-2007)
----------------

- Improved the content of the README.txt file. Added info about tests and example
  usage. [deo]

- Renamed, simplified and added a second field, non multiValued, to our demo
  schema. [deo]
