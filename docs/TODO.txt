Nice to have features
=====================
[ ] When you reference an existing file.  Then switch to 
    upload a referenced file.  The widget hides the previous
    (existing) reference you made.  Even while uploading 
    multiple files; you should be able to see the existing 
    references you selected.  The system works as expected
    unfortunately the UI does not.

    BUG: 
    - Looks like the behavior is different between items you
      select whie "Reference an existing content item" and
      "Upload a new file and reference it"
    
[ ] Explain in detail why the monkeypatch is being applied.
    Need more docs under patch.py; specifically what version
    of AT is required to make patch obsolete.

[ ] Do not require someone to click link "upload another file".
    Automatically present another file widget.  After they have
    selected a file.  If they do not upload a second file that is fine.

[ ] While displaying links to file's; show them as hyperlinks.  So
    someone can click on the link and goto the view of that content type.
    
[ ] Move the demo content-type to a dedicated GS profile
