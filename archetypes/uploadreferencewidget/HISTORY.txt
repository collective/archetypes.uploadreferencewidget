UploadReferenceWidget 1.2 - Unreleased

    - (changes)


UploadReferenceWidget 1.1 - Released November 26th, 2007

    - Fixed a persistence bug in the TestCase who was causing tests to
      behave in different ways depending on how they were run or on
      the Plone version.
      [deo]

    - Fixed the usage of 'startup_directory' in the demo.py code.
      [deo]

    - Made sure the widget honors the "use the current object" as the
      'startup_directory' when its value is "".
      [deo]

    - Fixed the "can't save the object" problem when the widget's field
      is marked as required.
      [deo]


UploadReferenceWidget 1.0.1 - Released November 16th, 2007

    - Reformulated the MonkeyPatch code to make it more robust and also
      to patch the right *class*.
      [deo]

    - Amended a test to work on all Plone versions.
      [deo]


UploadReferenceWidget 1.0 - Released November 14th, 2007

    - Fixed the text formatting of README.txt to use the StructuredText
      markup.
      [deo]

    - Fixed to not upload files when the form validation fails.
      [deo]

    - Added a MonkeyPatch for Archetypes BaseObject._processForm method,
      so we don't require the entire world to upgrade Archetypes to
      unreleased versions.
      [deo]


UploadReferenceWidget 0.5 - Released October 30th, 2007

    - Fixed to use the reference_edit macro from ATReferenceBrowserWidget
      (present in 1.7.2 and 2.0.1 versions), when available. This removes
      the double title/description field text.
      [deo]

    - Added a multi-upload feature. You can now upload more than one file
      at a time when the widget support multiple values.
      [deo]

    - Fixed a bug where the directory path wasn't being removed from the
      filename, when uploading from Internet Explorer to a Zope server
      running in OS different from Windows.
      [deo]

    - Improved the 'startup_directory' handling: if the path doesn't
      exists, the files are uploaded inside the instance itself (in case
      of a folderish object), or its parent.
      [deo]


UploadReferenceWidget 0.2 - Released September 10th, 2007

    - Improved the content of the README.txt file. Added info about tests
      and example usage.
      [deo]

    - Renamed, simplified and added a second field, non multiValued, to our
      demo schema.
      [deo]

    - Fixed the upload to also works when the field is not multiValued.
      [deo]


UploadReferenceWidget 0.1 - Released August 24th, 2007

    - Initial version.
      [deo]
