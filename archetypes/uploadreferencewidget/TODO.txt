Nice to have features
=====================
[ ] When you reference an existing file.  Then switch to 
    upload a referenced file.  The widget hides the previous
    (existing) reference you made.  Even while uploading 
    multiple files; you should be able to see the existing 
    references you selected.  The system works as expected
    unfortunately the UI does not.

[ ] Explain in detail why the monkeypatch is being applied.
    Need more docs under patch.py; specifically what version
    of AT is required to make patch obsolete.

[ ] Move the demo content-type to a dedicated GS profile
